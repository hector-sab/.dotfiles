# Awesome dotfiles
Prefered configurations for:
- Vim
- tmux

```
source install.sh
```

## VIM
Note that `vim` from the official ubuntu repositories does not support clipboard. The alternative is to use `vim-gtk3` or `neovim`. I prefer `vim-gtk3` right now due to the inability to use `CTRL+MOUSE_WHEEL` to change the font size in `neovim` under Konsole (KDE).
